## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Solution URL: [https://krakowcity.netlify.app/]
- Live Site URL: [http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html]

## My process
      I started by creating the HTML structure. This began with the design of the navbar and then the sections. Then there was the footer, which had links to the original Krakow city guide page as well as an Instagram account. I also included links to my LinkedIn and Twitter accounts. The page's center content included information and images.
      Once the initial page was layed out then the css came in. Designing the initial page was first with the use of a chosen color pallet and the use of animations and effects.

    At the moment, i still intend adding more sections to the page. Some unresolved issues includes having the winter write up come first in the mobile mode. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

The biggest thing i learnt working on this project was making it responsive. I have done a couple of challenges previously and most were responsive but i was still very confused on getting all the sections to be responsive. 
I used a class (fade) when i attempted to make an image slider that was automatic, this caused picture to flash when i reload and then dissapear after 1 second. I was stuck on this for a whole day trying to debug and at some point, had to ask for help. Now, i know this and look forward to more challenges.

### Continued development

- JavaScript
- CSS (transform properties, animations)
